# Elm-Yahtzee

Ugly and simple Yahtzee-based game written in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) 0.18.0.
[Play it.](http://chadselph.github.io/elm-yahtzee/)

## Running locally

Run `elm-reactor` from this directory and go to [http://localhost:8000/Main.elm](http://localhost:8000/Main.elm)

## What's left to do
* Less ugly UI
* Multiplayer?
